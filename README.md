# icyface_api
This is the rest api of icyface, it works with the model generated by [icyface_offline](https://github.com/bupticybee/icyface_offline) project. If you do not have the resource or the patience to train a model yourself, you can try to use this model trained by me:
[https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hrCzDVQ](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hrCzDVQ)

The project use tensorflow and tflearn for deep learning model and flask for rest api.
Run the project by this command:
```
python3 face_service.py [model_dir]
```
